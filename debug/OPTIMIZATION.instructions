# OPTIMIZATION & CLEANUP PROCESS - MASTER INSTRUCTIONS

**Version**: 1.0  
**Created**: January 15, 2026  
**Status**: Framework Ready  
**Process**: Analysis → Tasks → Code → Tracking → Completion  

---

## 🎯 MISSION STATEMENT

Transform codebase analysis findings into actual clean, efficient code through a systematic, tracked, observable optimization process that:

1. ✅ **Identifies** exact code locations that need changes (TODOs)
2. ✅ **Aligns** tasks with debugging system (DEBUGGING.md)
3. ✅ **Links** to MASTER_FEATURE_SPEC for intended design
4. ✅ **Tracks** progress from analysis → implementation → completion
5. ✅ **Ensures** final code is clean, efficient, documented
6. ✅ **Provides** clear next actions at every stage

---

## 📍 PHASE 1: CODE INSTRUMENTATION

### What: Add TODO markers at every location that needs change

Each code location that appears in task analysis gets:

```rust
// TODO [TASK-ID]: [Brief description]
// Reference: [AnalysisFile#IssueSection]
// Roadmap: [Step N of M]
// Status: NOT_STARTED|IN_PROGRESS|BLOCKED|COMPLETE
```

### Where: Code files

**File**: Any file mentioned in analysis documents (40+ files total)

**Pattern**:

```rust
// Example location from backend_security_patterns.md
// TODO [SEC-001]: Validate redirect_uri against ALLOWED_REDIRECT_URIS
// Reference: backend_security_patterns.md#oauth-1-incomplete-redirect-uri-validation
// Roadmap: Step 1 of 4
// Status: NOT_STARTED

async fn signin_google(
    State(state): State<Arc<AppState>>,
    Query(query): Query<SigninQuery>,
) -> AppResult<Response> {
    // ← INSERT CODE HERE
}
```

### Task: Add TODOs to Code

**Action Items**:

1. **For each CRITICAL task** (SEC-001 through SEC-006):
   - Locate exact file and line number from analysis
   - Add TODO comment with task ID
   - Include reference to analysis document
   - Set Status: NOT_STARTED
   - Create tracking entry

2. **For each HIGH task** (BACK-001 through FRONT-006):
   - Same as above
   - Mark as secondary priority if not in Week 1

3. **For MEDIUM/LOW tasks**:
   - Add TODOs for architectural changes
   - Keep cleanup-focused todos low-noise

**Locations to Instrument** (from task analysis):

**CRITICAL Security** (6 locations):
- `app/backend/crates/api/src/routes/auth.rs` (SEC-001, SEC-004)
- `app/backend/crates/api/src/db/gamification_repos.rs` (SEC-002, SEC-003)
- `app/backend/crates/api/src/middleware/security.rs` (SEC-005)
- `app/backend/crates/api/src/db/user_repos.rs` (SEC-006)

**HIGH Priority** (26 locations across backend/frontend):
- [See OPTIMIZATION_TRACKER.md for full list]

---

## 📊 PHASE 2: ALIGN WITH DEBUGGING SYSTEM

### What: Register tasks in debug/DEBUGGING.md

Each task gets an entry in `debug/DEBUGGING.md`:

**Format**:

```markdown
## [TASK_ID]: [Task Name]

**Status**: Phase 1: DOCUMENT  
**Severity**: CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW  
**Effort**: X hours  
**Location**: file.rs:line  
**Analysis**: [AnalysisFile#IssueSection](link)  
**Tracker**: [OPTIMIZATION_TRACKER.md#TASK_ID](link)  

### Issue
[Issue description from analysis]

### Solution
[Solution approach]

### Validation
[Acceptance criteria]

---
```

### Action: Create DEBUGGING.md Entry

**For each task**:

1. Copy task details from MASTER_TASK_LIST.md
2. Add to `debug/DEBUGGING.md` in priority order
3. Link to OPTIMIZATION_TRACKER.md for execution tracking
4. Mark status as "Phase 1: DOCUMENT"
5. Include reference to code location

**Example**:

```markdown
## SEC-001: OAuth Redirect Open Redirect Vulnerability

**Status**: Phase 1: DOCUMENT  
**Severity**: CRITICAL (10/10)  
**Effort**: 0.2 hours  
**Location**: app/backend/crates/api/src/routes/auth.rs:100-115  
**Analysis**: [backend_security_patterns.md](debug/analysis/backend_security_patterns.md#oauth-1-incomplete-redirect-uri-validation)  
**Tracker**: [OPTIMIZATION_TRACKER.md#SEC-001](OPTIMIZATION_TRACKER.md#sec-001-oauth-redirect)  

### Issue
Client can specify any redirect_uri after authentication, enabling open redirect attack.

### Solution
Validate redirect URIs against ALLOWED_REDIRECT_URIS whitelist before storing.

### Validation
- Redirect URIs validated against whitelist
- No arbitrary redirects accepted
- Integration tests cover redirect attack scenarios

---
```

---

## 🎯 PHASE 3: LINK TO FEATURE SPEC

### What: Connect tasks to intended design in MASTER_FEATURE_SPEC

**For each component** that has tasks:

1. **Find** matching section in MASTER_FEATURE_SPEC
2. **Note** intended design from spec
3. **Identify** gap between current code and intended design
4. **Add** reference to FEATURE_SPEC in task tracking
5. **Verify** implementation matches spec

### Integration Points

**Example**: SEC-001 (OAuth validation)

```markdown
**MASTER_FEATURE_SPEC Reference**:
- Section: "Authentication / OAuth Security"
- Intended Design: "All OAuth redirect URIs validated against configured whitelist"
- Current State: "No validation; client-provided URIs stored as-is"
- Gap: 0.2h work to add validation

**Link**: [MASTER_FEATURE_SPEC.md](../MASTER_FEATURE_SPEC.md#oauth-security-requirements)
```

### Components with FEATURE_SPEC Links

**Security Components**:
- OAuth flows → MASTER_FEATURE_SPEC.md#authentication
- Session management → MASTER_FEATURE_SPEC.md#session-security
- CSRF protection → MASTER_FEATURE_SPEC.md#csrf-prevention

**Backend Components**:
- Database models → MASTER_FEATURE_SPEC.md#data-model
- Error handling → MASTER_FEATURE_SPEC.md#error-handling
- Configuration → MASTER_FEATURE_SPEC.md#configuration

**Frontend Components**:
- Component organization → MASTER_FEATURE_SPEC.md#component-architecture
- State management → MASTER_FEATURE_SPEC.md#state-management
- Form handling → MASTER_FEATURE_SPEC.md#forms
