## Recommendation

Since Tier 1 is already 90% done:
1. **Verify** Tier 1 frontend integration (search, lock modal, crypto display)
2. **Start** Tier 2 from scratch (DAW tracking + Observability)
3. **Build** Tauri app alongside Tier 2
4. **Continue** Tier 3 & 4 as scheduled

**Status:** Ready for next phase
