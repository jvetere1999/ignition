The organization is:
- **Professional:** Core directories perfectly structured
- **Functional:** All systems operational
- **Documented:** Comprehensive guides and indices
- **Deployable:** Ready for immediate production deployment

The root directory has some documentation files that could be moved for aesthetic reasons, but this doesn't affect functionality, code quality, or deployment readiness in any way.

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Do Now)
```bash
cd app/backend && flyctl deploy
git push origin main  # Frontend auto-deploys
```

### Optional (Polish, No Urgency)
